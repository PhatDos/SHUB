## Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Guildance to execute the program

Make sure you have installed Node JS

First step, change directory to task1 in terminal

### `cd task2`

Then install pacckage

### `npm i`

To execute the program, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

## Technologies

- React for UI development  
- Formik for form state management and handling  
- Yup for schema-based form validation  
- CSS (App.css) for styling and error highlighting  

## File structure

   Since this is a small exercise (a single-page application), I used the App.js component directly instead of separating it into multiple folders. The App.css file handles the styling for the entire application.
