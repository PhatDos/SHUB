## Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Guildance to execute the program

Make sure you have installed Node JS

First step, change directory to task1 in terminal

### `cd task1`

Then install pacckage

### `npm i`

To execute the program, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

## Idea to solve the task

Firstly, I used xlsx library and FileReader to read data in Excel file and converse it to JSON type. As a result, I will have an array of object, each object is a row in Excel file.

Secondly, I used hook useTimeRange to manage startTime, endTime, and validation error, ensures startTime <= endTime. I also used TimeRangePicker - a controlled component that allows the user to pick a start and end time

Then, the handleCalculate function: 

It calculates the total amount using Array.reduce:
- Finds the first column key (Object.keys(row)[0]) to determine if the row is valid by check if the first column contains an integer or not, representing a real transaction row.
- Reads the time from column __EMPTY_1(hour) and the amount from column __EMPTY_7(money).
- Only sums the amount if the time is within the selected range.
- Updates the total state with the calculated sum.

Finally, UI elements: 

- File input to upload Excel.
- Time pickers for start and end time.
- Button to calculate total, disabled if thereâ€™s a validation error.
- Message display the calculation range.
- Total amount shows the result formatted as currency.
